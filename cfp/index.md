# CALL FOR PAPERS

The 2nd International Workshop on Search-Oriented Conversational AI (SCAI)

<http://scai.info>

[@scai\_workshop](https://twitter.com/scai_workshop)

at EMNLP 2018, Brussels, Belgium, Oct 31 or Nov 1 (TBD), 2018.


## GOALS
There is a gradual shift towards searching and presenting the information in a conversational form. Chatbots, personal assistants in our phones and eyes-free devices are being used increasingly more for different purposes, including information retrieval and exploration. On the other side, information retrieval empowers dialogue systems to answer questions and to get context for assisting the user in her tasks.  With the recent success of deep learning in different areas of natural language processing, this appears to be the right foundation to power search conversationalization. Yet, we believe more can be done for theory and practice of conversation-based search and search-based dialogues. This workshop aims to bring together AI/DeepLearning and search/IR specialists to lay the ground for it and establish future directions and collaborations.


## TOPICS OF INTERESTS
- Surfacing search results in form of a dialogue (how to present information that search gives us in a form of a dialogue and ensure smooth transition between dialog turns? Which model to use for dialog-state tracking?)
- Evaluation of Search-Oriented Conversational AI -- From Conversational AI to Personal Assistants (how to maintain a stable and consistent assistant behavior?)
- The role of personalization for Conversational AI and for its evaluation (users are different — can we personalize their experience?)
- Deep Learning for Conversational AI
- (Deep) Reinforcement Learning for Conversational AI
- Voice as Input (when we consider not only text input, but also voice interactions with the agent — how will it affect existing models?)
