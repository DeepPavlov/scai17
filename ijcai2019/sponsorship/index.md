## Sponsorship Levels

Sponsor benefits options (depends on the support level, see below):

(a)  acknowledgement in a particular category (Silver, Gold, or Platinum) and banner on our website

(b)  promotional material (flyers or booklets) for the workshop participants

(c)  5 min 'sponsored lighting talk'

### Levels:

- **Bronze** level sponsoring is an option only available for start-ups and SMEs and is meant to attract local industry. 
- **Silver** level sponsors get recognition as a silver sponsor on our website without further benefits. Basically, option (a).
- **Gold** level sponsors get recognition as a gold sponsor plus options (a), (b), and (c).
- **Platinum** sponsoring get recognition as a platinum sponsor plus options (a), (b), and (c).  For "Platinum" sponsors, we often make a tailored deal, for example, make them sponsor of a workshop social event.  We currently are still looking for a "reception" sponsor.
