## GOALS
More and more information is found and consumed in a conversational form
rather than using traditional search engines. Chatbots, personal assistants
in our phones and eyes-free devices are being used increasingly more for
different purposes, including information retrieval and exploration. On the
other side, information retrieval empowers dialogue systems to answer
questions and to get context for assisting the user in her tasks.  With the
recent success of deep learning in different areas of natural language
processing, this appears to be the right foundation to power search
conversationalization. Yet, we believe more can be done for theory and
practice of conversation-based search and search-based dialogues.

The aim of this edition of the SCAI workshop is to bring together researchers
from the Natural Language Processing (NLP), Artificial Intelligence (AI),
and Information Retrieval (IR) communities to investigate future directions
of research in the area of search-oriented conversational systems.
The focus of this installment seeks to broaden participation between
research and industry. The previous instances identified a number
of research areas related which warrant additional deeper exploration.
To provide a broad forum we solicit a variety of research
and position paper submissions. 

## TOPICS OF INTERESTS
* Surfacing search results or other information in form of a dialogue
  how to present information coming from search in a form of a dialogue
  how ensure smooth transition between dialog turns
  which model to use for dialog-state tracking
* Evaluation of Search-Oriented Conversational AI â€” From
  Conversational AI to Personal Assistants
* Personalization for conversational AI and for its evaluation
* Deep Learning for Conversational AI
* (Deep) Reinforcement Learning for Conversational AI
* Voice as Input (when we consider not only text input, but also voice
  interactions with the agent â€” how will it affect existing models?)
* Specialized applications and uses cases for conversational search
  (specialized domains in health, finance, travel, etc.)
